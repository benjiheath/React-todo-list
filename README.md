# React Todo-List

Following a preliminary introduction to React via tutorials & docs, I wanted to try my hand at making a todo-list from scratch. This served me well as a way to familiarise myself with the basics such as JSX, React components, props, hooks, and an understanding of how React manages state. It also highlighted the power of React in comparison to vanilla JS, which makes me even more eager to develop my skills.

Functionality is bare-bones, however I'm looking forward to adding more features along my journey learning React.
